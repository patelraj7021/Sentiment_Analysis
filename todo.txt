analysis:
- integrate z-score comparisons instead of raw scores

data:
- build database so analysis can have enough data for means to be meaningful

UI:
- make list for tickers
- make 'enter' work as button press
- make app have scroll bars if window size is too low

scraping:
- make scraping start at random time within set window
- wait random period of time between tickers
- account scan_tickers crashing

testing and documentation
- separate folder structure to be easier to follow (i.e., spider folder, django folder, etc.)
